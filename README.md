"STAY HOME" - WIP

Gameplay:

* Top Down/Arcade

* The game will show a town with a couple of houses where there will be civilians walking around. The player's main objective is to keep all the civilians safe from the virus (enemy: could be an infected guy with the virus as its face)

* The game will have a bit of a Whack-a-mole feel to it since after progressing through the game a bit, the speed and difficulty will rise and the civilians start walking around the place and gets harder to catch while the virus is chasing after them. (All the sprites will move at an equal speed. Like pacman) 

* Drops like sanitizers/soaps could be used as power items to neutralize the virus so that it will keep the game balanced. 

* Once the virus catches a player, he turns into one of the enemies and tries to catch other players. 


Points to be discussed:

1. Should it be endless?

2. Should it have upgrades for civilians? Like equipping face masks 

3. What mechanism is to be introduced here to avoid chaos
